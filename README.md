# Datepicker UI

A custom datepicker component built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of the roadmap.sh [Datepicker UI project] (https://roadmap.sh/projects/datepicker-ui).

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a functional datepicker interface with calendar navigation, date selection, and responsive design. The goal is to practice positioning, layout, and styling techniques in CSS while building an interactive UI component.

## Features

- **Interactive Calendar**: Month and year navigation with previous/next controls
- **Grid Layout**: Properly aligned weekdays and date cells with borders
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different devices and screen sizes
